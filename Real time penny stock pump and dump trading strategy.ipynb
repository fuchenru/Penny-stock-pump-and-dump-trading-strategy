        "This project aims to guide you through how people exploit group decision bias and the herd effect to deceive investors into chasing the hype of penny stocks. The inspiration for this project stems from a paper authored by Peter (same author in this project), titled \"Behavioral Economics - Group Decision Bias in the Stock Market,\" which was published in the Economics department at Michigan State University.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this project is to illustrate how retail investors and traders frequently experience overconfidence, attentional deficits, self-attribution bias, active trading, and loss aversion, all of which contribute to biased investment decisions. In the presence of such biases and the herding effect, investors often rely on their own preferences, psychological factors, or the comments of others when making investment decisions."

        "1. Research and Analysis: We will utilize the pyfinviz library to conduct real-time scans of target penny stocks. This library will be constructed in a class format, making it easy for users to adjust parameters for future use.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. OpenAI API: We will leverage the OpenAI API to generate fake insider news. In this phase, we will employ a large language model such as ChatGPT to create hypothetical news, such as breakthroughs in potential cancer cures or new technologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Social Media: We will utilize social media platforms to disseminate these news stories. It's important to note that we will only outline the approach and will not provide any code or connect to any social media APIs due to legal and ethical considerations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Monitoring Tools: For real-time monitoring of stock price movements and market trend analysis for future trading strategies, we will utilize the yfinance library from Yahoo Finance.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Trading Strategy: We will develop a simple pump and dump strategy for demonstration purposes only. This will involve actions such as mass buying if there is a greater than 3% increase, and selling out positions when there is a 50% return. Additionally, we will implement a stop loss at -10%. It's important to note that these parameters can be adjusted for future use."
