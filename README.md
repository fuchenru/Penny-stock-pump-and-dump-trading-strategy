# Real time penny stock pump and dump trading strategy

This project aims to guide you through how people exploit group decision bias and the herd effect to deceive investors into chasing the hype of penny stocks. The inspiration for this project stems from a paper authored by Peter (same author in this project), titled "Behavioral Economics - Group Decision Bias in the Stock Market," which was published in the Economics department at Michigan State University.

The purpose of this project is to illustrate how retail investors and traders frequently experience overconfidence, attentional deficits, self-attribution bias, active trading, and loss aversion, all of which contribute to biased investment decisions. In the presence of such biases and the herding effect, investors often rely on their own preferences, psychological factors, or the comments of others when making investment decisions.

## Usage

To use this toolkit, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Scanner**: Create an instance of the `PennyStockScanner` to begin scanning for stocks.

```python
from penny_stock_analysis import PennyStockScanner

scanner = PennyStockScanner()
scanner.scan_stocks()
```

2. **Fetch Prices and Company Names**: After scanning, retrieve the current prices and company names for further analysis.

```python
prices = scanner.get_prices()
company_names_dict = scanner.get_company_names()
```

3. **Generate Hypothetical News**: Use the `HealthcareNewsGenerator` function to generate news for each company.

```python
HealthcareNewsGenerator(company_names_dict)
```

4. **Simulate Trading**: Based on the generated news, simulate trading strategies and visualize the portfolio's performance over time.

```python
simulate_trading(portfolio, prices)
```

5. **Visualize Results**: Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize the results of your analysis and trading simulation.

## Configuration

- **OpenAI API Key**: Set your OpenAI API key in the `HealthcareNewsGenerator` function to use the news generation feature.

```python
openai.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
